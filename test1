House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he will publicly release all Capitol Hill security footage from January 6, 2021, that does not contain sensitive information, in a move to please his right-wing members.

GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has led the charge in pushing party leadership – beginning with former Speaker Kevin McCarthy – to release the recordings, but others have jumped on the bandwagon including Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Chip Roy of Texas.
